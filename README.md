# Flask_basic

#### This is to document the entire process of developing a web application using Flask framework.
I personally use Visually studio code as the starting step of building a flask framed web app with minimal front end
> ## Directory Structure setup
---> Open Visual studio code and create an empty folder for the Flask webapp.

---> Inside Flask web app create another folder with website name you want and file as "main.py" .

---> Inside website their is a standard requirment for folders( static and templates ) and python files (such as views, models, authentication).

---> Create __init__.py file inside website folder to run whatever given inside the file.

> ## Required libraries to install locally
---> To make the web app successfull, the following libraries are important and required to install in local system
---> given commands are run on cmd(command prompt)
##### for flask:
'''
pip install flask
'''
##### for login using flask: using logging in
'''
pip install flask-login
'''

##### for flask database: it's a kind of wrapper for sql
'''
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
'''
